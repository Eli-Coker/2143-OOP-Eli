## H04 - Understanding Polymorphism in OOP
### Eli Coker
### Description:

Polymorphism is a key principle in OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It comes in different formsâ€”most notably compile-time polymorphism (method overloading) and runtime polymorphism (method overriding). This assignment focuses on understanding when and why polymorphism is used, along with a minimal demonstration.
